Feature Engineering:

The app can do feature transformation and one-hot encoding:

For Feature transformation:

You can select up to three variables to do the following: 

No change/log-transformation/Normalizing/Standardizing

When you uploaded a file, the app will automatically show three variables. To modify which variables to use, just use the delete button in your keyboard and delete existing variables. And use the drop down button to add new variables to it. By choosing the suitable transformation and clicking on "Apply Transformation", you will see the histrgram of the transformed feature. 

For One-hot Encoding: 

You can select one variable to do the one-hot encoding, but make sure you choose the categorical variable. After selecting one variable and selecting the "One hot encoding" button and clicking "Apply Transformation" button, the tab-One-hot Encoded Data will show the output of the one-hot encoding.
